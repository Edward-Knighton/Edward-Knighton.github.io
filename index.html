                <h1>Intro</h1>
                <p>
                    During Spring Break my Junior Year, some friends from KTP and
                    I attended the University of Cincinatti's hackathon RevolutionUC.
                    Originally we created the beginnings of a  react-native mobile 
                    application for our fraternity. However, we wanted this 
                    project to become something bigger, as well as be a learning
                    resource for others in the fraternity. Something that people
                    could easily pick up and work on for a short period of time.
                    The initial steps to start developing/testing with react-native
                    proved to be too much, so we decided to refactor it into a 
                    mobile-first progressive web app built using VueJS. 
                </p>
                <h2>What it Does</h2>
                <p>
                    We wanted this application to serve somewhat as a closed 
                    social network for members of  KTP. Also we hoped that it 
                    would help us manage and market to new members during the 
                    rush process each semester. The app serves as a one stop 
                    shop to view all information about the fraternity, whether 
                    that be seeing / checking into upcoming events. Managing your
                     points and meetings, or finding information on the other brothers.
                </p>
                <h2>How it's built</h2>
                <p>
                    A lot of the decisions we made in the implementation of this
                     application we're based around ease of enabling new and 
                     inexperienced members to be able to contribute as quickly 
                     as possible. Due to VueJS's easy set up process and clear
                      and precise documentation we decided this was the best 
                      framework to build the app with. For styling we are using 
                      custom classes on top of the CSS framework Bulma. For the 
                      backend due we chose to use firebase due to it's interactive 
                      console as well as comprehensive free tier. For hosting we 
                      use Netlify for many of the same reasons as firebase. Netlify's 
                      github integration is also perfect for highly distributed 
                      teams such as ourselves since it allows any member to quickly 
                      preview what the status of other branches being worked on are. 
                </p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    I have learned an incredible amount about what it means to 
                    design and implement an application by being the lead of 
                    this team throughout this process. Not only have my software 
                    development skills benefitted, but I have better learned what 
                    it's like to manage and lead a tech team.

                  <h2>Inspiration</h2>
                  <p>
                      When we considered the theme of "building a better Ann Arbor,"
                       we quickly agreed that getting around the city was something 
                       that everyone struggles with and that we could find innovative 
                       solutions for improving. Most onerous among the many challenges 
                       to getting around in Ann Arbor is that of parking. We wanted 
                       to make parking easier by providing comprehensive information 
                       about parking garages, street parking, and even enable the 
                       monetization of unused driveways and front yards by matching 
                       people who need a space with those that have it! From here 
                       we aimed to bundle in as much useful information to maximize 
                       people's enjoyment our wonderful city once their parking 
                       problems are a thing of the past!
                  </p>
                  <h2>What it does</h2>
                  <p>
                    XplrA2 uses crowdsourced data to provide comprehensive 
                    insight into parking availability and options in Ann Arbor. 
                    We cover everything from parking garages and lots to street 
                    parking, including cost, availability, and more - we even 
                    report parking attendant location - and mood! Additionally, 
                    we incorporate non-traditional parking opportunities via our 
                    ParkShare functionality, which allows users to advertise 
                    their available driveways or front yards (for example during 
                    Michigan games or Art Fair!) and to match their availability 
                    with eager parkers. We provide up-to-the-minute construction 
                    information for drivers, bicyclists, and pedestrians, and we 
                    even send you SMS reminders about your parking spot!
                  </p>
                  <h2>How we built it</h2>
                  <p>
                    We started out by brainstorming any and all features that we 
                    thought could be of use to those exploring the Ann Arbor area, 
                    and then thinned those results to the most valuable, most achievable 
                    subset. We drafted the architecture, database schema, and front 
                    end functionality on a whiteboard, and then began identifying 
                    technologies that would facilitate our goals. Adobe XD and Zeplin 
                    helped us digitize our whiteboard scribblings into usable assets. 
                    We selected Vue.js and Bulma to help us assemble an attractive, 
                    well-structured web UI. We simplified our back end by using Firebase, 
                    and got around iOS's lack of support for web-based Push Notifications 
                    by instead implementing SMS via Twilio. Since Twiliodoesn't support 
                    client-side JavaScript, we used Node.js via Firebase's (serverless) 
                    Cloud Functions. With our UI fleshed out and our frameworks in 
                    place and working, it was simply a case of wiring everything 
                    up. And wire we did, for many many hours, eventually realizing 
                    all of our interfaces in Vue/Bulma bound to data from Firebase!

              <h1>About</h1>
              <p>Although this project is incredibly less expansive than my other 
                two projects, it was still really fun to  work  on a team to 
                design it as well as learn more about how to write marketing copy. 
                <br>
                In order to correctly demonstrate and convey the value that KTP 
                gives to its members, I established the 5 Pillars of KTP which 
                are demonstrated on our home page: Professional Development, 
                Academic Support, Social Growth, Technical Advancement, and Alumni
                Connections, or PASTA for short. This drastically helped our 
                marketing efforts as each brother was able to give a more 
                consolidated message on why KTP has helped them, while also 
                allowing  enough leeway to put their own personal spin on it 
                and the message staying fresh.
